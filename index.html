<H1>MONICA SMITH</H1>

<H3>ADVISOR</H3>

<H6>ABOUT</H6>
<P>My name is Monica Smith. I am a 32 years old. I am a recovering addict, I was in prison, and I have HIV. I have been through all kinds of situations and can relate to just about any type of person. I have had a rough life and made some choices that took me down a rough road. The reason I am an Advisor is because of what I have been through. What the Devil used for bad My Higher Power is using for good. I am here because I know how a person feels when they find out they are positive,they are fighting with addiction, and/or they feel hopeless and ALONE. I have been hit with things that would make a person just give up. Instead, I am choosing to use all of that to help others better themselves. I am now a college student studying Psychology. I have a great support team of doctors, medical care, mental care, housing, and anything that can help pull you out of the pit of despair. I want to provide the same support I was given so that YOU know you're not alone and there is something better IF you are willing to ask for help.</P>

<H6>WORK</H6>
<P>I am here to give a listening ear and give support. I will point you in the direction to get you help physically and mentally.</P>
